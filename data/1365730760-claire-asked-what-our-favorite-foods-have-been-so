It&rsquo;s hard to pick winners, but Indian breakfasts are much more savory than Western ones and don&rsquo;t feature eggs. The idli (rice in UFO shapes) have been delicious dipped in sambar, but my favorite has to be the dosa we&rsquo;ve been eating everywhere we go. </p>\n\n<p>We&rsquo;ve avoided meat for the most part, but I had a very nice prawn with mint curry in Pondicherry and a great mutton kati roll in Cochin that stand out. </p>\n\n<p>So far, no &ldquo;travelers disease&rdquo; despite eating all kinds of things everywhere. Haven&rsquo;t had dessert, really. By the time I finish my thali I&rsquo;m usually stuffed. Unlikely to come home skinnier than I left.</p>\n\n<p>No discussion of food would be fair without mentioning the chai everywhere served in little cups!</p>"}
